**Project Ship Battles**

*Note:* The files here don't make up the whole project. They are just the most important part of it, to show how the project functions.
There is a tutorial on how to play the game in-game.

There is currently little documentation, due to the size of the scripts,
And mainly the fact that I am the only one working on this project.
