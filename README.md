**Project Ship Battles**

*Note:* The files here don't make up the whole project. They are just the most important part of it, to show how the project functions.
There is a tutorial on how to play the game in-game.

There is currently little documentation, due to the size of the scripts,
And mainly the fact that I am the only one working on this project.

**Wanna Play The Game?**

In case you would like to play the game, contact me using the details in my GitHub Account, or visit: <https://a123xxsp.dynu.com/shipbattles>,
and download one of the versions :)

*NOTE: The Android Version is playable, but there is a problem with ship movement, since the game was originally created for computers.*
